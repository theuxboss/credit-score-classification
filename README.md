# credit-score-classification

### Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a credit approval system using machine learning techniques. The system will analyze various factors related to credit scoring, utilizing secondary data from Kaggle, which provides a rich source of credit-related information including individuals' bank details and other relevant factors. The system will assess loan requests and inform customers whether their request falls under the categories of good, poor, or standard credit.

### Data Source:

The primary data source for this project will be Kaggle datasets containing credit-related information. These datasets include various features such as credit history, income, loan amount, employment status, etc. The data will be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

### Data Preprocessing:

* Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing values appropriately.
* Outlier detection and treatment: Identify outliers and apply suitable techniques to handle them.
* Data normalization/standardization: Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity.
* Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Analyze distributions of features.
* Explore correlations between features and the target variable.
* Visualize relationships between different variables.
* Identify patterns or insights that may inform feature selection and modeling decisions.

### Feature Engineering:

* Create new features that may enhance the predictive power of the model.
* Select relevant features based on EDA and domain knowledge.

### Model Selection:

* Experiment with various machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
* Utilize techniques like cross-validation to evaluate and compare the performance of different models.

### Model Training and Evaluation:

* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Train the selected models on the training data.
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Fine-tune hyperparameters of the best-performing models to optimize performance.
